Please do either of these two options:
1. Add a button labelled 'Voters List' against each Candidate area, so as to display the detailed voting patterns and who and who that voted for each candidate.
2. Or, hyperlink each candidate areas to open the detailed voting patterns and who and who that voted the Candidate, when clicked upon.

Please add Settings for 'Nomination Fee' here. This fee is charged on every Candidate/Contestants for any election, which will be automatically debited on the Candidates' Wallet when such 'Declare for Election'. This Fee paid goes completely to the Community Account, but necessary Service Charge are also debited against the Candidates Wallets in respect thereof. This Service Charge is a certain percentage of the Fee paid - as Mobigate Admin will Set/Edit (15% - 30%).

Note: provide necessary button labelled 'Declare for Election'' from where interested members can register their ambitions to run for any elective offices.

23/01/2026, 23:05 - Mr Peter Iprec 2: This Certificate of Return should be a pre-designed Certificate signed automatically by Mobigate. However, the Winner's names will automatically be embedded thereon as soon as the Community Admin clicks on the button 'Issue Certificate of Return' or the moment the Winner clicks on 'Download Certificate of Return' from his User's interface. This Download button can only become 'active' or visible as soon as the Candidate is declared Winner.

Please remember: All Communities operate in their respective local currencies, not in Mobi. However, every transactions thereof are automatically translated/converted to Mobi, as and being a universal Currency on Mobigate Applications. Mobigate Charges on Communities, Individual Members and Users across all Mobigate Applications are Debited/Credited in Mobi - which in turn are translated/converted to the Communities', or Members'/Users' local currencies.

In other words, Mobigate Applications (except Mobi-Store) deals with all categories of Users - whether public or private, Communities or individual Users in its universal Currency - Mobi, but translates/converts values to such Users' local currencies. So, all Users' transactions or earnings are basically in their respective local currencies which are resultant values from Mobi - Local Currency or Local Currency - Mobi Conversion Rates.

Any candidate who secured up to 25% of Votes in Primary Elections, will automatically be qualified to run in the General Election. However, General Elections can only accommodate a maximum of 4, and minimum of 2 Candidates/Contestants with highest number of Votes in Primary Elections.

Add: 'Community Settings' down below (lastly). This will feature all or most Community Settings including the ones on the Admin Panel. All Settings will be shown to all valid Members for necessary Approvals/Disapproval. The Admins manage all Settings, but Members can 'Disapprove' and 'Recommend New Settings'. Admin Settings becomes active the moment 60% of Members 'Approve' such. Also, if up to 60% of Members 'Disapprove' and 'Recommend New Settings', the 'Recommended Settings' with majority will automatically become the valid Settings even on both Admin Panel and Members Panels. Even the Admins cannot be able to change or alter any such Settings without Members' Approval. So, the moment the Admins reset/modify any Settings, necessary prompts will display on all Members Panel requesting for 'Approval' or 'Disapproval'. In any case, Members 'Disapproval' cannot stand unless the same 'Recommend New Settings'.

On 'Create Campaign', I didn't see 'Upload File' media uploader so as to enable Candidates upload necessary Campaign images.

Also, 'Create Campaign' button should be made available to and on Candidates' Dashboards, not just on Admin Panel alone: it's not wrong to be on Admin Panel anyway, but basically, it should be on Candidates' Dashboards primarily. So the moment a Candidate declares for Election successfully, the 'Create Campaign' button will appear on his Dashboard.
25/01/2026, 09:22 - Mr Peter Iprec 2: These analysis are not necessary on the Admin Dashboard. The only thing needed here is 'Candidates' Campaign Royalty' which is the Amount value of whatever percentage of the Campaign Fees paid, as Mobigate System allot to each primary Community of such Candidates. Records may be kept under each Candidate's Campaign. Remember, Candidates choose different Campaign Requirements or parameters as they want: the optional features. So, proceeds may not necessarily be the same on every Candidate's account.

All Community's available or applicable Offices will be displayed to be Selected, active select buttons.

Please add feature: '+ Declare New Election' or simply, 'New Election' button first on the row, before 'Campaigns'. From this button Community Admins can easily Declare Election Seasons and for all or any specific Offices, hence: 'General Elections' and 'Supplementary Elections'. 'Supplementary Elections' are single elections for one or some Office declared vacant by Resignation, Impeachment, Death or any other. Declaring a new Election, proper reason of vacancies thereof should be stated.

Consequently, whenever any such Elections are Declared, it will require Votes of PG/Chairman, Secretary, and (any of) Publicity Secretary or Legal Adviser; or the Secretary, Publicity Secretary, Legal Adviser, and (any of) Director of Social or any other Admin, for the Election Declaration to become active and valid.

Also, another button ' *Impeachment* ' will be required, just after 'Winners' and before 'Settings'. With this button, members can start 'Impeachment' Process against any Officer, but 85%-100% Votes of active Members will be required to effect a valid or successful Impeachment of any Officer. And once any Impeachment is successful, the Office will automatically be declared and flagged 'Vacant', and such an Officer's Admin Password will automatically become Invalid!
28/01/2026, 20:00 - Mr Peter Iprec 2: This Impeachment Process will only be valid for 30 Days, after which the Process will be automatically Aborted if the required Impeachment Votes (85%-100%) are not achieved within this stipulated time frame.

Impeachment Notification: will start displaying the moment an Impeachment Votes reach 25%; and every Valid Members will be able to see this Notification. Even the Votes count thereof will be visible to the members on their respective individual Dashboards. <This message was edited>
